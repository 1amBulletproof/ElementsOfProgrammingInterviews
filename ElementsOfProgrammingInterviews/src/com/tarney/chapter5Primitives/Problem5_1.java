 * Solution to problem 5.1 on page 43 of Elements of Programming Interviews
 * <p>
 * <em>Problem:</em> The parity of a binary word is 1 if the number of 1s in the word is odd; otherwise it is 0.
 * For example, the parity of 1011 is 1, and the parity of 100001000 is 0. Parity checks are used to detect single bit errors in data storage and communication. 
 * It is fairly straightforward to write code that computes the parity of a single 64-bit word. 
 * <strong>How would you compute the parity of a very large number of 64 bit words?</strong>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <em>Hint: Use a lookup table, but don't use 2^64 entries!</em>
 * </p>
